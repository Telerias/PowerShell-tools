# In Powershell cmd  prompt, please navigate to the location where you have saved the IIS logs, and
# run the below command : 

Get-Content ".\*log" | ? { ($_ | Select-String "/ews")}  

# The above command would give us all the EWS requests.

To filter this to a particular user name, use the below command:

Get-Content ".\*log" | ? { ($_ | Select-String "/ews") -and ($_ | Select-String "Useralias")}  

# Some more options that will be more commonly required : 

# For Outlook Web Access : Replace EWS with OWA 
# For EAS : Replace EWS with Microsoft-server-activesync 
# For ECP : Replace EWS with ECP

# To find out the count of the EWS request we can go ahead and run the below command

(Get-Content ".\*log" | ? { ($_ | Select-String "/ews") -and ($_ | Select-String "Useralias")}).count
